/**
 * This type encapsulates a comparison in which a property of a node or relationship was used. The property may appear
 * on the left hand side or right hand side or even on both side of the comparison (think being used in a function on
 * both sides with different arguments). The {@code clause} attribute will specify the context in which the comparison
 * was made.
 * <p>
 * The expressions used in the comparison are provided as Cypher-DSL AST expressions. They can be freely visited or rendered
 * into Cypher via the {@link org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.renderer.GeneralizedRenderer} like this:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     var cypher = Renderer.getRenderer(Configuration.prettyPrinting(), GeneralizedRenderer.class)
 *          .render(comparison.left());
 * }</pre>
