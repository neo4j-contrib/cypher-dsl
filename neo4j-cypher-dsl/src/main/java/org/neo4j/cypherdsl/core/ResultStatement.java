/**
 * A statement that returns items from the graph. The shape of those items can be pretty much anything:
 * A list of records containing only properties, or nodes with properties mixed with relationships and
 * so on. The only guarantee given is that the query will return some data if a match happens.
 * <p>
 * This class spots several methods that allow statements to be used with an instance of the Neo4j Java Driver.
 * To use any of the {@code fetchXXX} methods, the driver must be present on the class path. The corresponding Java module
 * is {@code org.neo4j.driver}.
 * <p>
 * We don't add any overhead to the process but only use what's already there. The {@link QueryRunner} passed to any
 * of the methods can be a session, a transaction or also the Spring Data Neo4j specific query runner.
 * <p>
 * <strong>We don't commit or rollback any transaction nor do we close a session. That is up to the caller.</strong>
 * <p>
 * Any parameter in this statement containing a value will be passed directly to the driver. The driver does
 * a relatively good job converting most parameters. If in doubt or the result is wrong, use an appropriate overload of
 * {@code org.neo4j.driver.Values#value(parameter)} to convert the parameter.
 * <p>
 * The methods taking in any reactive type also require Project Reactor on the class path with
 * {@code reactor.core} being the corresponding Java module.
