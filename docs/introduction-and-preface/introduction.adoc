== Purpose

The Cypher-DSL has been developed with the needs of Spring Data Neo4j.
We wanted to avoid string concatenations in our query generation and decided do go with a builder approach, much like we
find with https://www.jooq.org[jOOQ] or in the relational module of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jdbc/tree/1.1.6.RELEASE/spring-data-relational/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/relational/core/sql[Spring Data JDBC], but for Cypher.

What we don't have - and don't need for our mapping purpose - at the moment is a code generator that reads the database schema
and generates static classes representing labels and relationship types.
That is still up to the mapping framework (in our case SDN).
We however have a type safe API for Cypher that allows only generating valid Cypher constructs.

We worked closely with the https://www.opencypher.org[OpenCypher spec] here and you find a lot of these concepts in the API.

The Cypher-DSL can also be seen in the same area as the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/query/Criteria.html[Criteria API] of Spring Data Mongo.

== Where to use it

The Cypher-DSL creates an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree[Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)] representing your Cypher-Statements.
An instance of a `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Statement` representing that AST is provided at the end of query building step.
A `Renderer` is then used to create literal Java-Strings.
Those can be used in any context supporting String-based queries, for example with the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java driver] or inside embedded procedures and of course with Spring Data's https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/neo4j/core/Neo4jClient.java[Neo4j-Client].

Parameters in the generated queries will use the `$form` and as such be compatible with all current versions of Neo4j.

Users of SDN 6+ can use the generated `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Statement` directly with the `Neo4jTemplate` or the `ReactiveNeo4jTemplate`.
Both the imperative and the reactive variants allow the retrieval and counting of entities without rendering a String first,
for example through `Neo4jTemplate#findAll(Statement, Class<T>)`.
