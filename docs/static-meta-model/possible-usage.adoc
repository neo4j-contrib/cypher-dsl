== Possible Usage

Please assume we did model the "Movie graph" (`:play movies` in Neo4j-Browser) with the following scheme

image::movie-graph.png[]

and these classes, which have been generated with the
<<static-meta-model.building-blocks, building blocks described earlier>> (the required functions have been omitted for brevity):

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
final class Movie extends NodeBase<Movie> {

	public static final Movie MOVIE = new Movie();

	public final Property TAGLINE = this.property("tagline");

	public final Property TITLE = this.property("title");

	public final Property RELEASED = this.property("released");

	public Movie() {
		super("Movie");
	}
}

final class Person extends NodeBase<Person> {

	public static final Person PERSON = new Person();

    public final Property NAME = this.property("name");

	public final Property FIRST_NAME = this.property("firstName");

	public final Directed<Movie> DIRECTED = new Directed<>(this, Movie.MOVIE);

	public final ActedIn ACTED_IN = new ActedIn(this, Movie.MOVIE);

	public final Property BORN = this.property("born");

	public Person() {
		super("Person");
	}
}

final class ActedIn extends RelationshipBase<Person, Movie, ActedIn> {

	public final Property ROLE = this.property("role");

	protected ActedIn(Person start, Movie end) {
		super(start, "ACTED_IN", end);
	}
}

final class Directed<E extends NodeBase<?>> extends RelationshipBase<Person, E, Directed<E>> {

	protected Directed(Person start, E end) {
		super(start, "DIRECTED", end);
	}
}

=== Work with properties

Properties can be used like normal objects:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=work-with-properties]
----

Of course, new properties can be derived:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=deriving-new-properties]
----

=== Query nodes or relationships by properties

Use `withProperties` (and `named` you like) to model your queries as needed.
Applicable to properties of nodes such as the title:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=query-node-by-properties]
----

and relationships

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=query-rel-by-properties]
----

Note that the query will look like this, as we didn't rename the objects and they used generated names:

[source,cypher]
----
`MATCH (dZVpwHhe000:`Person`)-[JcVKsSrn001:`ACTED_IN` {role: 'Neo'}]->(cDWeUJSI002:`Movie`) RETURN cDWeUJSI002`` as we didn't specify aliases)
----

=== Work with relationships

Relationships can be worked with like with properties:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=multiple-relationships]
----

They are quite flexible together with the `inverse` method. The following example also shows how to include non-static parts:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=chaining-relationships]
