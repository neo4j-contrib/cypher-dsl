== Introduction

The Cypher-DSL is - apart from https://github.com/apiguardian-team/apiguardian[API Guardian] - dependency free.
It has however some optional dependency you can add to use more functionality.
One of those dependencies is the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j-Java-Driver].
The Neo4j-Java-Driver - or sometimes Bolt for Java or Bolt-Driver - implements Neo4j's Bolt protocol
and provides a connection to a single Neo4j instance or a cluster.

While the Cypher-DSL creates statements that eventually will be rendered as a `String`, it has some knowledge about the
statements generated:

* Will the statements return something?
* Or will the statements just run updates?
* Will the statements be profiled?
* Do the statements carry parameter definitions and values for parameters?

We can use that knowledge to provide a thin shim for using the Cypher-DSL with the API the Neo4j-Java-Driver provides
without reinventing the wheel.

In most cases the Cypher-DSL will generate one of two types of statements:

* `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Statement`: A statement without a result. It can be executed, but it cannot be fetched.
  You will be able to check for the number of affected database entities tia the driver's `ResultSummary`.
* `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.ResultStatement`: A statement known to have a result. It can be executed or fetched.

Both interfaces provide the appropriate methods, which will be discussed below.

NOTE: This API is not required to use the driver nor is the driver required for using the Cypher-DSL.
      The main API provided with the Cypher-DSL is `Statement#getCypher()` for retrieving a Cypher-String and optional call
      to `Statement#getParameters()` to retrieve parameters stored with the statement.
      +
      Those can be used in many ways and forms with the Neo4j-Java-Driver or mapping frameworks like
      Neo4j-OGM or Spring Data Neo4j 6+.

== Add additional dependencies

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Neo4j-Java-Driver added via Maven
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
	<artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
    <artifactId>4.2.4</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Any 4.x version of the Driver will work, we currently test against 4.2.4.
In case you want to use our integration with reactive sessions, you will have to add https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor].
We took the freedom to settle on one of the reactive libraries out there for our integration.

The publishers defined by Reactor can be converted into other libraries types or you can use the driver directly.
The driver itself uses the vendor agnostic https://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams spec].

The coordinates are:

[[imperative-api]]
== Imperative (blocking) API

You create an instance of the Neo4j driver.
This instance should be a long living instance in your application:

.Create a driver instance

----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=create-driver]
----

Both `org.neo4j.driver.Session` and `org.neo4j.driver.Transaction` implement a `QueryRunner` (the same applies for the
reactive variants).
It is your responsibility to pick the right kind of interaction with the database (auto commit, transactions or transactional functions).
If you pass a `Session` to the Cypher-DSL, auto commit transactions will be used. If you pass in a transaction object,
unmanaged transactions will be used and you must commit or rollback as needed and take care for retries.

A safe bet is to pass one of the Cypher-DSL methods to the driver as a READ or WRITE transaction.

TIP: The Cypher-DSL won't close, commit or rollback anything you pass to it. You open resources, you close them. In all
     cases where the Cypher-DSL opens or provides a resource, it will take care closing it correctly.

Our goal when writing this small integration with the official driver was to apply best practices when working with the
driver without adding too much cognitive overhead or introducing new types.

=== Executing statements

We first have a look at statements that don't return data, but may execute updates or call stored procedures.
We will use <<statement-without-result,the following listing>> as example:

[[statement-without-result]]
.Example statement that does not return any data.
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-without-result]
----

==== Inside transactional functions

The driver has the concept of _transactional functions_. This basically describes a transaction manager understanding the
semantics of a Neo4j cluster, possible errors that can occur, routing and such.
The transaction manager is able to retry statements in certain error cases.

Transactional functions are passed as `TransactionalWork<T>` to a session.
The `executeWith` API on `Statement` fits this interface and you can pass it as a method reference.
It will always return a result summary:

[[statement-without-result-tx-function]]
.Executing statements in a managed transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-without-result-tx-function]
----
<.> Open a session
<.> Pass the `executeWith` method from the Cypher-DSL statement to the driver
<.> Do something with the result summary

TIP: Read more about transactional functions in the official manual: https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/4.0/session-api/configuration/#driver-simple-transaction-fn[Imperative sessions and transaction functions].

==== With an unmanaged transaction

A transaction you retrieve from a session is called unmanaged transaction.
It is your responsibility to commit or rollback and close it.

[[statement-without-result-unmanaged-tx]]
.Executing statements in an unmanaged transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-without-result-unmanaged-tx]
----
<.> Get a transaction from the session
<.> Pass it to the statement, execute and get the result summary
<.> Do more things in the transaction, than commit or rollback it

The advantage here is that you have more control and are not limited to idempotent operations for the transactional function.
The disadvantage has been hidden away in that example: You have to take care of exceptions that might happen due to cluster
errors yourself.

If you want to use an auto-commit transaction (for example for a `PERIODIC COMMIT` or an APOC call), just pass a `Session`
to `executeWith`.

=== Fetching data

The following examples will use this statement, returning the title of movies in the Movie-Graph:

[[statement-with-result]]
.Example statement that does return data.
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-with-result]
----

We provide two forms of accessing data via the imperative API: Pulling everything into a list or streaming records.
The <<reactive-api,reactive API>> is fully non-blocking and uses a publishing API.

==== Inside transactional functions

[[statement-with-result-tx-function]]
.Fetching statements in a managed transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-with-result-tx-function]
----
<.> Open a session
<.> Pass the `fetchWith` method from the Cypher-DSL statement to the driver
<.> The `readTransaction` (or `writeTransaction`) returns whatever the transactional work returns
    Our transactional work `fetchWith` returns a `java.util.List` of records
    Here we turn it into a Java stream (not connected to Neo4j) and map and collect it

`fetchWith` does support a second parameter, a mapping function `Function<Record, T> mappingFunction`. We can use this
with a transactional function as well and do the mapping inside the transaction.
For the example, this form here is easier to read, but the other one may have benefits in regards of memory allocation.

You also can stream the result. In contrast to the plain Driver API, we don't hand out the stream itself but expect a
closure dealing with the stream. We do this to make it impossible to use the stream - which is still connected to the database -
outside the transaction. With managed transactions, it looks like this:

[[statement-with-result-tx-function-stream]]
.Streaming statements in a managed transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-with-result-tx-function-stream]
----
<.> Open a session
<.> Open a managed transaction, but don't pass a method reference this time
<.> Instead, call `streamWith`, pass the transaction and a consumer for the stream `s`.
<.> Inside this example, we fully materialize the stream and map records as they pass by
    As the streaming method will always return the result summary, this will also be the type of the transaction function

==== With an unmanaged transaction

Now the same examples with unmanaged transactions. First, listening them. Here we pass a mapping function directly to `fetchWith`.
The pattern of opening a session and transaction is the same as before.

[[statement-with-result-unmanaged-tx]]
.Listening results with an unmanaged transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-with-result-unmanaged-tx]
----
<.> The unmanaged transaction passed to the statement,
<.> and the mapping function applied. `moviesTitle` is a `List` containing `String` elements in the end.

The streaming example looks pretty similar to the one applied with the transactional function.
As we pass the `Session` object itself, we are using an auto-commit transaction.

[[statement-with-result-auto-commit-stream]]
.Streaming results with an auto-commit-transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-with-result-auto-commit-stream]
----

Again, please note that the stream is only available in the closure. It is not meant to live outside the transactional scope.

[[reactive-api]]
== Reactive API

For the reactive API only the variants inside a transactional function are presented as they are probably the most complex
ones to get right: You have to deal with to resources: The session itself and the inner publisher returned from the transactional
function.

=== Executing statements

The most important part in the following example is not necessarily our API, but the use of Reactors `fromDirect` operator when converting
a publisher of a single element into a `Mono`: That operator trusts the user that the publisher will return zero or one element
and doesn't cancel after the first item being emitted and thus rolling back the transaction:

[[statement-without-result-tx-function-reactive-stream]]
.Reactive streaming results with an managed transaction
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-driver/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/drivers/ExecutableStatementsIT.java[tag=statement-without-result-tx-function-reactive-stream]
----
<.> The session should be opened non-blocking and as late as possible
<.> This is the actual call from the Cypher-DSL into the driver
<.> Closed what you opened
<.> The reactive `executeWith`-variant returns the summary as well

=== Fetching results

This example uses our original statement and arbitrary skips 2 elements and then takes only 30 elements.
As the transaction is managed by the driver, canceling the publisher via `take()` won't rollback the transaction.
