== Prepare dependencies

Please use a dependency management system. We recommend either Maven or Gradle.

=== Gradle configuration

.Inclusion of the Neo4j Cypher-DSL in a Gradle project

== How to use it

You use the Cypher-DSL as you would write Cypher:
It allows to write down even complex Cypher queries from top to bottom in a type safe, compile time checked way.

The examples to follow are using JDK 11.
We find the `var` keyword especially appealing in such a DSL as the types returned by the DSL much less important than
the further building methods they offer.

IMPORTANT: The AST parts and intermediate build steps are immutable. That is, the methods create new intermediate steps.
For example, you cannot reuse an `ExposesLimit` step, but have to use the returned object from its `skip` method.

An instance of a `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Statement` is provided at the end of every query building step.
This `Statement` needs to be rendered into a string or passed to methods supporting it as input.

Please get an instance of the default renderer via `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.renderer.Renderer#getDefaultRenderer()`.
The renderer provides a single method `render` for rendering the AST into a string representation.

Furthermore, the `Statement` will collect parameter names and if provided, parameter values.
Parameter names and values are available after the statement has been build and can for example be used directly with
Neo4j-Java-Driver.

=== Examples

The following examples are 1:1 copies of the queries you will find in the Neo4j browser after running `:play movies`.

They use the following imports:

.Imports needed for the examples to compile
[source, java]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/CypherDSLExamplesTest.java[tag=cypher-dsl-imports]
----

To match and return all the movie, build your statement like this:

.Simple match
[source, java,indent=0,,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/CypherDSLExamplesTest.java[tag=cypher-dsl-e1]
----
<.> Declare a variable storing your node labeled `Movie` and named `m`, so that you can
<.> reuse it in both the match and the return part.
<.> The `build` method becomes only available when a compilable Cypher statement can be rendered.

==== Find

==== Retrieving parameters being defined

A placeholder for a parameter can be defined via `Cypher.parameter("param")`.
This placeholder will be rendered as `$param` and must be filled with the appropriate means of the environment you're working with.

In addition, an arbitrary value can be bound to the name via Â´Cypher.parameter("param", "a value")` or `Cypher.parameter("param").withValue("a value")`.
`NULL` is a valid value.
The Cypher-DSL will not use those values, but collect them for you.

The following example shows how to access them and how to use it:

[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/CypherDSLExamplesTest.java[tag=collecting-params]
----
<.> The names contain all placeholders, also those without a value
<.> The parameter map contains only parameters with defined values

If you define a parameter with conflicting values, a `ConflictingParametersException` will be thrown the moment you try to retrieve the collected parameters.
