== 2022.0

=== 2022.0.0

Starting with the 2022 release line, all current experimental warnings have been removed, and we consider our API stable.

==== Noteworthy

As we have marked the API as stable we do enforce semantic versioning in our builds now.
The parser module `neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser` has been updated to the Neo4j 4.4 parser and therefore doesn't bring in Scala dependencies anymore.
And last but not least, we added the _Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct_.
